### September 25th, 2018

The Budget document was created in the form of a Microsoft Excel document. This excel sheet includes all cost details and description of any and all parts that are to be ordered by October 2nd, 2018. All subtotals, taxes, grand totals, shipping costs and currency exchange rates based on USD to CAD have been provide per item.

### October 2nd, 2018

Alterations were made to the original Budget sheet (i.e. the source of puchases) in order to produce a lower total budget cost. Instead of using common USA based sources, additional Canadian based companies were found that helped reduce my overal shipping costs by $53.
Please note the invoices below are strictly based on mandatory items (eg. Raspberry Pi 3 and VEML6070 sensor purchases). Additional purchases may be made from local hardware/computer stores for cables if reuired. Please refer to the links below:

### October 9th, 2018

Reading Break - No commits or documentation submitted. No additional information to report.

### October 16th, 2018

Due to certain personal constraints, alterations were made to the parts orderlist (i.e. contacting vendors to reduce delivery times).
In addition, further discussions occured between myself and the supervising instructor in order to maintain a stable development process by meeting all critical path requirements and future milestone/module due dates (as displayed in the Gantt Chart). No documentation commits occured during this time.

### October 16th, 2018

Pending.
