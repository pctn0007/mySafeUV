Anthony Pacitto's Hardware Blog - mySafeUV
----------------------------------------------

### Week 1 - September 6th, 2018

The selection of a address 0x39, also known as the VEML6070 UV Index Sensor was selected via the specification list provided by our supervising instructor. An discussion board submission was logged to claim the address/sensor and the creation of mySafeUV project name was assigned. Please refer to the link below for Fall 2018 I2C slave device and list item 24. with the assigned name Anthony:

### Week 2 - September 11th, 2018

The mySafeUV GitHub public Repository was created for storing and modification of all hardware-based documentation.
The mySafeUV project proposal was submitted and comitted for review. Please refer to the specified link below:

### Week 3 - September 18th, 2018

The mySafeUV Project Schedule (i.e. Gantt Chart via Microsoft Project) was created and committed. This document will provide a detailed approach on a week-to-week critical path that establishes deadlines, tasks and timeframe of development. Please refer to the link below:

### Week 4 - September 25th, 2018

The Budget document was created in the form of a Microsoft Excel document. This excel sheet includes all cost details and description of any and all parts that are to be ordered by October 2nd, 2018. All subtotals, taxes, grand totals, shipping costs and currency exchange rates based on USD to CAD have been provide per item.

### Week 5 - October 2nd, 2018

Alterations were made to the original Budget sheet (i.e. the source of puchases) in order to produce a lower total budget cost. Instead of using common USA based sources, additional Canadian based companies were found that helped reduce my overal shipping costs by $53.
Please note the invoices below are strictly based on mandatory items (eg. Raspberry Pi 3 and VEML6070 sensor purchases). Additional purchases may be made from local hardware/computer stores for cables if reuired. Please refer to the links below:

### Week 6 - October 9th, 2018

Reading Break - No commits or documentation submitted. No additional information to report.

### Week 7 - October 16th, 2018

Due to certain personal constraints, alterations were made to the parts orderlist (i.e. contacting vendors to reduce delivery times).
In addition, further discussions occured between myself and the supervising instructor in order to maintain a stable development process by meeting all critical path requirements and future milestone/module due dates (as displayed in the Gantt Chart).

### Week 7 cont. - October 17th, 2018

A standard breadboarding diagram was created using Fritzing software application. The diagram contains the basic connections between the Raspberry Pi 3 and the VEML6070 sensor, using the VIN (5V), SCL, GND and SDA pins. However, to form a ACK connection (outputs warnings of very High UV index readings) is still to be determined: Please refer to the Fritzing diagram file below:
