# mySafeUV
UVI portable detector for skin cancer patients, providing them with a visual representation using color codes.

# Introduction to the development
In today's society, there are many UVI detection devices. However, many skin cancer patience have very minimal knowledge on the various UVI values and their associated index rating (i.e. extreme, very high, high, normal, etc.). Moreso, the availability of a small, yet portable detection devices have only recently been used by general public. With respect cancer patients, the only tangible item that are used to warn/express concerns regarding skin cancer and UVI are standard brochures and standard online information provided by cancer-based foundations.

In this build instruction set, we will learn how to develop a simple, but effective UV Index sensing device that will not only detect the UV index of various light sources, it will display them in a readable format for any doctor, scientist, average Joe or student to recognize and interpret.

#Step 1 - Planning and Design:
To start, it is important to get an idea and make note of all the required hardware and/or material you may need. For this project, I have included the required components, as well as a potential aquiring source and total pricing (CAD):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRIMARY HARDWARE:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Raspberry Pi of your choice (I used 3 B+)
        --> Amazon.ca ($119.00 CAD)
  2) VEML6070 UV Index sensor (0x039) 
        --> Adafruit.ca ($15.37 CAD)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL PARTS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Acrylic 3D printing material of your choise.
        --> Provided by post-secondary school (i.e. you may want to outsource this).
  2) Safety goggles (Safety first!)
  3) Ribon cables with both male and female contact ends
        --> Amazon.ca (Included with Pi kit)
  4) Standard breadboard (for testing purposes)
